2.2
    - Added/Removed mobs:
      - Removed sword, bow, armor, knight, bow knight, and ancient zombies.

      - Removed thief, bow, ancient, and bow ancient zombie pigmen.
      - Added spitfire skeleton (jockey-only mob).
      - Added charging and fishing zombie pigmen.
    - Changed the way vanilla mobs are handled.
      - Vanilla mobs now only exist as spawn proxies for special mobs. This means you will never technically fight a vanilla mob with this mod installed, and uninstalling the mod will cause all hostile mobs covered by this mod to vanish (until more respawn, of course).
      - This change also allows me to modify the equipment all mobs spawn with.
      - Additional spawn data relating to equipment from spawners is ignored (sorry, but now way around this right now).
    - General texture/behavior changes:
      - Mobs use the vanilla AI again (even though it's still a bit weird).
      - Thief skeletons and thief wither skeletons now just make you drop your held item (and emeralds, if you have any) and rely on the vanilla pickup AI (which is a lot dumber, but oh well).
      - All skeletons, zombies, and zombie pigmen now use the melee attack animation, even when not holding an item.
      - All skeletons, zombies, and zombie pigmen can now spawn as ancient mobs (configurable chance).
      - Special skeletons now all have a wither version/texture.
      - Special zombies now all have a villager and baby villager version/texture.
      - Zombies and skeletons now randomly vary in speed.
    - New properties! - Most properties default to vanilla's hard mode values.
      - Villager infection rate, bow chances, armor and weapon configs, random item names, ancient chances.
    - New enchantments! These enchantments are only obtainable through drops.
      - Plague, Poison, Gatling, Spitfire
    - Plague, poison, and fire mobs now rely on their equipment for their hit effects!
      - These mobs can, of course, drop their equipped item! Find a poison or plague weapon or (if you're lucky) a legendary Gatling or spitfire bow!
    - As a result of these changes, many mobs are a lot stronger. Good luck!
2.1
    - Overhauled the mod's spawn system.
      - Any time a vanilla mob or special jockey is spawned, it is immediately replaced by a special mob (or left the same, the rates depend on the config) or special jockey combination.
      - Consequently, special mobs no longer naturally spawn.
      - Removed all restrictions from vanilla mob spawn rates in the config!
        - This means you can completely remove vanilla mobs (like say, all creepers) from the game if you're a wimp.
      - Ender crepers no longer spawn in the End, due to the new spawning method. They may return in the future.
    - Refined and improved the special jockey system.
      - All special jockeys (and any mounted mobs, even from other mods as long as they extend EntityMob or EntityGhast) will re-combine when the world is reloaded. They also try their best to not glitch while doing so!
      - In creative mode, you will see a new spawn egg! It is called Spawn Jockey and will, obviously, spawn a jockey. (There is a slight delay before jockeys appear.)
      - Added the mini ghast mount! Yeah I know, ghasts in the overworld don't fit the theme, but these are just so dang cool!
      - Due to the spawn changes, armor spiders now have the same spawn rate option as pig and ghast mounts.
    - Added a few special ghasts! You can now see baby, unholy, queen, and king ghasts in the Nether!
    - Modified drops slightly. The code for drops should be unnoticably faster and use insignificantly less memory.
      - Ancient mobs will now also uncommonly drop emeralds.
    - Bug fixes!

    - Mod Update Manager is no longer included!

    - Merged mod mostly with its Spawner Support.
